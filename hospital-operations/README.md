# AI in Hospital Operations & Management

## Overview

AI is transforming hospital operations by optimizing patient flow, staffing, supply chain, and resource allocation. Operational AI addresses the systemic inefficiencies that cost US hospitals an estimated $200B+ annually in waste, while improving patient outcomes through better coordination and faster response times.

**Market Size:** Healthcare operations AI — $3.2B (2024) → projected $12.5B by 2030
