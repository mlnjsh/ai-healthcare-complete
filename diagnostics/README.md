# AI in Clinical Diagnostics

## Overview

AI diagnostics encompasses AI systems that help detect, classify, and predict diseases from clinical data — including lab results, vital signs, symptoms, and genetic information. Beyond imaging (covered separately), diagnostic AI is transforming point-of-care testing, laboratory medicine, genomics, and clinical reasoning.

**Market Size:** AI diagnostics (non-imaging) — $2.1B (2024) → projected $9.8B by 2030
